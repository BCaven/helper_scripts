# helper_scripts
collection of helper scripts for linux, primarily written in Shell and Python.

I am running [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) on [fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)

All scripts are built with my system in mind, no guarentee that they will work for you, but here they are anyways.

Old scripts are kept here as a small record of past projects.
